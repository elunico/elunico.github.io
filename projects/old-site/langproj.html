        Constructed Languages (or conlangs) are languages that are created purposely
        by individuals or a group, rather than evolved naturally over time by
        human communication. There are many reasons why people conlang including
        but not limited to fantasy world-creation for games or story telling,
        giving people a common neutral language for international communication,
        linguistic exercises or challenges that involve making languages with certain
        constraints, secret codes, linguistic experiments or sometimes just for fun.
        Regardless, of why a person or group creates a language, a lot goes into it,
        and it can be a surprisingly rich reflection of the people who made it and the context
        surrounding its creation.
      </p>
      <p class="progPageDescription">
        I have been fascinated by language for many years and
        minored in linguistics, and for me, creating languages has always been a great way
        to explore various linguistic principles and phenomena. When creating a language,
        one can choose to start from nothing, building up a language from its most fundamental
        words and elements, perhaps simulating evolution over hundreds of years according to known
        linguistic principles. They can also start with a language or family that exists and
        imagine how small variations or dialects might play out over time. While I have taken
        both approaches, I tend to prefer the latter. Taking Latin as my base,
        I have created a number of hypothetical Romance languages among other kinds of languages as well.
      </p>
      <p class="progPageDescription">
        Many of the languages that I have created are at varying levels of
        completion. This is because, typically, if I find a language
        is not working in practice as well as it is in theory I will choose
        to change things up, but I usually leave the language where it is
        and start again on the same base but without whatever the problematic
        feature is. Furthermore, it is hard to say when any language is complete.
        Conlangs, like natural languages, can evolve either by natural spoken
        processes (a good example of this is <a target="_blank" ref="noreferrer noopener" href="http://talossan.com/">El
          Glheth Talossa</a> by
        R. Ben Madison) or it can "evolve" purposely by the creator
        defining evolutionary rules.

          Llengua Provitana

      </h2>

      <div class="projectDescription">
        <p><i>Llengua Provitana</i> is a constructed Romance language and one of the most recent
          languages I created. It is based on the languages around Catalonia in Spain and has
          a heavy resemblance to Catalan. It differs in some key ways and includes
          some "regional variation" between two fictitious regions of east and west. The
          eastern dialects tend to contain more Spanish-like features and western dialects tend
          to contain more French-like features, as if the language was spoken in modern day
          Catalonia.
        </p>
        <p>
          This language was very fun to create. Being later in my conlang jouney, it was
          a more familiar process. I was inspired to create this after leanring more about
          the languages of Western Spain. I really enjoy Catalan and I think this might be the language
          most similar to an existing language that I have ever created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provitan exists as an article on <a target="_blank" ref="noreferrer noopener"
            href="http://conlang.fandom.com/wiki/Provitano">The Conlang Wiki</a>
          where a description of the language can be found.

        Lingua Lațiense
      </h2>
      <div class="projectDescription">
        <p><i>Lingua Lațiense</i> is another constructed Romance language (I have something of
          a thing for Romance languages) that is a little older than Provitan. Latiense
          is fairly well developed and unlike the other Romance languages I created, it is
          an eastern Romance language.
          Specifically it is a language that lies east of La Spezia–Rimini Line.
          In Romance linguistics, this is a line along the northern part of Italy that
          separates two broad families of Romance languages: Eastern Ones and Western Ones, and
          there are several characteristics that belong to each family that tend not to cross that line.
          (I am simplifying a little bit here) such as pronunciation of soft 'c' and the
          mechanism behind pluralization of nouns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Latiense is unlike most Romance languages in that it has a noun declension system.
          Nouns in Latiense change endings not only for singular and plural as they do in Spanish,
          English, and many other languages, but also for their role in the sentence. You would
          expect the word 'child' in the sentences 'I saw the child' and 'The child saw me' to
          have different endings in Latiense, not unlike how the word 'I' in English takes
          different forms. The only major Romance language to feature this is Romanian, so this
          was a fun aspect of the language to explore. Like Romanian, and unlike many
          modern Romance languages, however, Latin does have an actually quite extensive
          case system for nouns, so its not so much that Romanian or indeed Latiense is innovative
          as much as they are less willing to part with features of Latin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Latiense does not currently exist anywhere on the Internet as
          Provitan does. This is due to it being a little older and not as well
          organized in its documentation as Provitan.

          Tilõ Niqacaw
        </a>
      </h2>

      <div class="projectDescription">
        <p><i>Tilõ Niqacaw</i> is a conlang that is not based on any other
          language. That is not to say that it uses features that are unheard of
          in any language. In fact it uses sound and grammar features exclusively found in
          natural human languages. However, the choice of which
          features are used and their combinations as well as all the sounds that are present, and
          the vocabulary that it uses are all made up from scratch with little influence
          from existing languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tilo is the most developed <i>a priori</i> conlang that I
          have made and it is also the most recent. It is also one of my
          favorites as the philosophy and design behind it, to me,
          it the best and nicest looking. That being said, it is still
          fairly behind the development of the Romance languages. This is due
          to the sort of "template" that Romance languages provide.
          Creating a conlang of a Romance language can be quite restrictive,
          because there are many sources of features that can be drawn from.
          In the case of something like Tilo, <u>everything</u> has to be
          chosen and decided on, so its a much slower process. None of the
          <i>a priori</i> languages I have created are as far along in development
          since they require so much building. Even when the grammar and the sounds
          of the language are laid out, it remains nearly unusable until
          sufficient amounts of vocabulary are created from scratch. Since
          Tilo, like all of my conlangs, aim to sound natural, though very foreign,
          to humans, it is necessary that the vocabulary be self-consistent and
          make sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this being said, there is a page on the Conlang Wiki where you
          can find some information on <a href="http://conlang.fandom.com/wiki/Tilo" target="_blank"
            ref="noreferrer noopener">Tilõ Niqacaw</a> and how it works so far
