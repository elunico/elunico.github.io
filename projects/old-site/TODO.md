# Things to Do

## Missing Things
-  ~~Still need resume~~
-  ~~Still need example for language projects~~
-  ~~Have text in the buttons centered and in the middle~~
-  ~~Add experience and skills?~~
-  ~~Fix linkedIn link~~
-  ~~Fix resume link~~
-  ~~Fix language sample area~~
-  ~~Fix green images on home page~~
-  Should experience and skills be on website if its on resume?
-  Move back to GitHub and fix links

## Considerations
-  ~~Should I use express and render templates?~~
-  ~~Should I use express to retrieve information?~~
-  ~~Should I use a microservices archetecture?~~
-  ~~Should I add some API routes ???~~
-  ~~use localStorage to prevent reanimation unless explicit refresh is requested?~~

## Refactoring
-  ~~Fading elements should be tied to a "fade" css class so that I can use js to get all fade elements~~
-  the classes in progproj should be renamed and moved to common.css

## Critical Bugs
-  *NONE*

## Major Bugs
-  ~~Sometimes the pages fade out then in instead of just in on first load~~
  -  ~~Only happens when not using cache (i.e. in Incognito or with Inspector open)~~
-  ~~Command history is not persistant between pages/sessions~~
-  Command history relies on pushing members in and out of stacks which is a linear time operation that will scale poorly if the user issues a lot of commands and wants to backup through them

## Minor Bugs
-  ~~when going back the fade is broken~~
-  ~~The command status timeout is not refreshed when a new command is isssued~~
-  ~~Cursor character looks odd on Safari on MacOS (10.14)~~
-  Images fail to load on Safari on MacOS (10.14) but I don't know why because following the link directly yields images

## Fun Things
-  ~~Add more photos of projects~~
  -  ~~maybe a Gallery or a page that hosts simple photos (boring)~~
  -  ~~probably would want template or some sort of plug n play thing for gallery work~~
-  Add state so scrolling actually scrolls to next div (use scrollIntoView())
-  ~~Add VIM style commands~~
