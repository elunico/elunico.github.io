      <p class="projectDescription">
        A simple text editor written in Java 10 using JavaFX. This was
        an exercise in JavaFX and GUI design. It is a fairly simple text editor that
        has autosave, recovery features, multiple windows, open/save/duplicate,
        copy, cut, paste, find, replace, and insert time/date features. It was modeled after
        notepad.exe on Windows 10. JPEdit also supports a very rudimentary plugin system.
        A person can implement the JPEditPlugin interface on a class and by adding the class
        to a jar, load functionality into JPEdit. This system is fairly simple, but does
        enable some substantial functionality to be side-loaded.

      <p class="projectDescription">
        This is a browser-based implementation of <a href="">Conway's Game of Life</a>
        by John Conway. It is a cellular automata, 0-player, Turing complete game.
        The basic idea is cells (squares) are set in a pattern of living (black)
        or dead (white) and then the system evolves according to rules.
        Overcrowded or lonely cells die, and with just the right conditions,
        cells come to life. You can find out more on the Wikipedia Page!.
      </p>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        My implement allows a couple of things. First you can either run the
        simulation or step through it slowly. You can also click or click and drag
        on the canvas to change cell states and finally you can save and
        load the <b> initial random state </b>, if you find one you like a lot.
      </p>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        This program is made using
        <a href="http://processing.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Processing Foundation</a>'s
        p5.js library for working with the canvas. I am a huge fan of the Processing Foundation
        and love p5.js especially for how easy it makes creative-coding in the browser.
      </p>
      <p class="projectDescription">
        Although I am not affiliated with any of these channels, people, or organizations, creating this implementation was inspired by
        <a target="_blank" ref="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk2MH9O4pXY">this
          Youtube Video from Alan Zucconi</a> as well as

          The Coding Train's Video on the topic</a>
        and by the amazing life and incredible work of John Conway who died in 2020 due to complications from COVID-19.

      <p class="projectDescription">

        SocDraw is a collaborative drawing application for real-time shared canvas
        drawing between multiple clients. The application is based on the idea of a
        room. A room is simply a canvas, all associated drawing data, and the
        clients connected to the room. Rooms are created on demand when a user chooses
        to do so from the home page. Rooms are identified by a sequence of 4 random
        words. Users can share this sequence with others who can use it to join
        the room and draw on a shared canvas in real time. When all members leave a
        room there is a short grace period where reconnections are permitted
        before the room and all associated drawing data is destroyed. Clients
        who connect to an existing room will have the current state of the canvas
        transmitted and immediately appear when entering. This program is made using
        <a href="http://processing.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Processing Foundation</a>'s
        p5.js library for working with the canvas. The collaborative aspect is built using
        <a href="http://socket.io" rel="noopener noreferrer">socket.io</a>.

        Custom YouTube Speed is a simple Chrome extension for controlling the
        playback speed of YouTube videos with more granularity and options than the
        default player. You might already know that YouTube will let you adjust the
        playback rate of the videos you watch by steps of <code>0.25</code> from <code>0.25x</code> normal
        speed up to <code>2x</code> normal speed. My extension allows you to go
        from <code>0.1x</code> normal speed to <code>8x</code> normal speed in increments
        of <code>1.0</code>, <code>0.5</code>, <code>0.1</code>, and <code>0.05</code>.
        It also adds keybindings to <code>+,</code> <code>-,</code> <code>*,</code>
        <code>/,</code> and <code>`</code> and allows you to save a default
        preferred speed. You can find it

        The Redistricter

      <p class="projectDescription">
        The Redistricter is a single page web app whose purpose is to optimize the shape, size,
        and contents of US Congressional districts in a way that maximizes certain characteristics
        as determined by the user. It consists of a front-end using jQuery, leaflet, and bootstrap,
        to display a map of states and draw precinct and district data to it. It also presents the user
        with several options for optimization goals in forming the districts such as compactness of
        shape, party fairness, and equal distribution of population. The back-end is written in Java
        using Apache Tomcat and JDBC and MySQL for persistence. The goal of this application was
        to be able to systematically draw district lines to prevent gerrymandering and have districts
        which are drawn based on objective criteria instead of to force a partisan advantage. It was
        done in a team of 4 over the course of the Fall 2018 semester at Stony Brook University for CSE 308.

      <p class="projectDescription">
        DuplicateFileManager is a program written in Java and Kotlin that can recursively scan
        any number of directories and detect duplicate files that exist between them as well
        as within the directories themselves and subdirectories if done recursively. This
        is accomplished by hashing the files. A number of hashing methods are
        available to the user to select. Once hashed, the user can add more directories
        to check for duplicates, remove ones that have been scanned along with their
        duplicates from view, open files, show files on disk, delete files, delete all
        duplicates of a file, and export the results to CSV. The results are presented
        as a filename, path, and the hash of the file. This allows sorting by hash, thus placing
        all duplicate files next to each other, or sorting files by name for convenient searching.
