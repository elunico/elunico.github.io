The ranking categories were recently updated on Sept 12, 2025. The ranking is mostly the same but the categories are more narrowly defined to aid in discernment:
  []
Pens I would Buy If I Started Over (in order of purchase):
  - Uniball JetStream (0.7mm) 3 colors (Black, Blue, Red) - Most versatile pen. Uni Super Ink is permanent and the ink flows well anywhere. Plus its a ballpoint so it will write on just about anything and anywhere and highlights well.
  - Uniball Signo 307 (0.5mm) 3 colors (Black, Blue, Red) - A great Gel pen. Very smooth, also permanent ink. Great for everyday writing.
  - Pentel EnerGel (0.7mm) All colors - Super smooth, great for work, best colors, and great for highlighting.
  - Pilot Frixion (0.5mm) in black and blue for erasable notes.
  - After this I would get some more colors and a couple of other pens I like like the Pilot Precise or the Vision pens as the need or want arises.
Items I would buy if I started over (in order of purchase):
  - A Hobonichi Planner A6 - I use my planner so much everyday I would need this. If most were sold out I would try an April start or sometimes you can get the second half of an Avec online later in the year. If I really couldn't get one, I would get a Stalogy A6 and then date it myself
  - A spiral notebook from Rhodia or Maurman Mnemosyne - I like spiral notebooks for work notes and I like the paper in these two brands, I would want something I could tear out easily and use for work notes.
  - A Leuchtturm1917 A5 Notebook - Very versatile notebook, good paper, and a great size. Good for working things out or doing planning or project breakdowns—could be a journal in a pinch.
  - A Midori MD A5 Notebook - Great paper, very versatile, and a good size. My favorite journal paper.
Accessories I would buy if I started over (in order of purchase):
  - Hobonichi Memo Pads (Weeks Size) - Great for quick notes, lists, and reminders. Fits perfectly in a planner or notebook.
  - Post it notes
  - Tombow Mono Correction Tape - The best correction tape I have ever used. It goes on smoothly and covers well.
  - Acrylic Ruler - I use this all the time for underlining, drawing lines, and measuring things. A good clear one is best.
  - Tombow Mono Eraser - The best eraser I have ever used. It erases cleanly and doesn't smudge or tear paper.
  - Midori Clear Cover for Notebooks - Protects notebooks and gives them a nice finish.
  - JetPens Kanso Blotting Paper - Useful for fountain pen users to prevent smudging and keep hands clean.

(<i>Disclaimer</i>):
  - <i class="disclaimer">I only rank pens that I like. Even a pen ranked last in a category is still good and I will use it, it just ranks below other pens in that category. Pens I have tried but do NOT like at all are listed (not ranked) separately</i>
